My co-author Nick Polson and I first thought of this book as a way to answer all the great questions our students had about AI: how does a self-driving car work, how does Alexa understand what I’m saying, that sort of thing.  We noticed that there was a lot of writing about AI that was very technical, a lot that was borderline science-fiction (["the robots are coming for you!"](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x), and a lot that was pop sociology — but that if you wanted a non-technical version of how this stuff actually works, or sometimes doesn’t work, you were stuck.

But then along the way, we realized that the public narratives surrounding AI were simply broken.  On the one hand, you have this incredible amount of hype from people in the business world.  Companies are buying ads during the Super Bowl touting AI, they’re hanging billboards from the rafters of airports — and they’re all claiming that AI is going to fix the health care system and sell more widgets and make your shit smell like roses.  And on the other hand, you have others claiming that AI is going to destroy everything we care about, from our jobs, to our privacy, to our democracy.

So with AI, we’ve clearly reached the point where a non-expert can’t tell the difference between the hype and the reality.  And so as educators, Nick and I came back to a simple bedrock: it’s really important for people to have a sense of what’s hot air and what’s genuine promise; what’s sci-fi dystopia and what’s a real policy issue.
