Hi, I'm James Scott.  I am a statistician and data scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.  Here you can find information about [my research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/), the [books and articles]({{ site.baseurl }}/books/) I've written, and [the classes I teach]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/).  

Here at UT I have a joint appointment in the [McCombs School of Business](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/) and in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.utexas.edu/) in the College of Natural Sciences.  I also have a courtesy appointment in the Department of Computer Science.  My wife [Abigail Aiken](https://lbj.utexas.edu/directory/faculty/abigail-aiken) is also on the UT faculty, in the LBJ School of Public Affairs.  

### Recent work

I've recently finished writing a book, [_AIQ: How People and Machines are Smarter Together_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250182158?tag=macmillan-20) (jointly with my colleague Nick Polson).  _AIQ_ will be published by [St. Martin's Press](https://us.macmillan.com/smp/) in May 2018, and it answers lots of question people tend to have about artificial intelligence.  What is AI?  How does it work?  Where did it come from, and how is it changing the world?  For more information, see my [Books and Articles]({{ site.baseurl }}/books/) page.  

In my academic research, I collaborate as a data scientist with scholars in a wide range of fields.  My recent collaborative projects have involved health care (especially maternal and child health), security, infectious disease, and neuroscience.  In the past Iâ€™ve also done work in linguistics, political science, finance, astronomy, and molecular biology. 

I also research various topics in statistical theory and methods and theory, mainly in the area of Bayesian inference. 

### How to reach me

You can reach me by e-mail at james.scott@mccombs.utexas.edu.  

My office is in CBA 6.478 in the business school.  This is somewhat hard to find: it's on the 6th floor of the south wing of CBA, on the east side of the building, i.e. on the side facing Speedway and Gregory Gym.  The easiest way to get there is go up the elevators in CBA (not the ones in GSB).  When you reach the 6th floor, walk straight ahead under the sign for "Behavioral Lab," turn left, and continue following the hall as it bends to the right around until you find my office.  (NB: I have nothing to do with the Behavioral Lab, although I've had students remark that finding my office feels like a behavioral experiment.)

You can sometimes find me instead in GDC 7.516 in the statistics department.  This is on the 7th floor of the north tower of GDC.  Take the elevators on the north side, i.e. on the side of the central atrium opposite the little coffee shop.
