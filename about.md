Hi, I'm James Scott.  I am a statistician and data scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.  Here you can find information about [my research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/), the [books and articles]({{ site.baseurl }}/books/) I've written, and about [the classes I teach]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/).

You can reach me by e-mail at james.scott@mccombs.utexas.edu.  

Here at UT I have a joint appointment in the Department of Information, Risk, and Operations Management (in the McCombs School of Business), and in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences (in the College of Natural Sciences).  I also have a courtesy appointment in the Department of Computer Science.

My office is in CBA 6.478 in the business school.  This is somewhat hard to find: it's on the 6th floor of the south wing of CBA, on the east side of the building, i.e. on the side facing Speedway and Gregory Gym.  The easiest way to get there is go up the elevators in CBA (not the ones in GSB).  When you reach the 6th floor, walk straight ahead under the sign for "Behavioral Lab," turn left, and continue following the hall as it bends to the right around until you find my office.  

You can sometimes find me instead in GDC 7.516 in the statistics department.  This is on the 7th floor of the north tower of GDC.  Take the elevators on the north side, i.e. on the side of the central atrium opposite the little coffee shop.

If for some reason you have to mail me something, my mailing address is:
